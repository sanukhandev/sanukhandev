👋 Hey there!
 I'm Sanu Khan, a 🚀full stack developer based in Dubai. I've been building my career in programming since I was 16, and I absolutely 💖love what I do.

My journey started with OOP concepts in core PHP, and I gradually expanded my skills to include different PHP frameworks and CMS. Over the years, I've dived into JAVA and ASP.net, and then became curious about Javascripts. I started front-end development with JS and JQurey, and later explored other technologies like AngularJS, ReactJS, TypeScript, NodeJS, and expressJs.

I've worked with many clients across the 🌍globe, delivering some really cool HTML websites for startups and small-medium businesses. I've also developed a real-estate ERP solution based on PHP and Angular, and a university students social networking app using React Native, Angular, Python Django, and Postgres.

One of my current projects is a medical application 💊, but I'm also passionate about research into AI and AI innovations, and cyber security. I believe that these fields have the potential to transform the world and bring about positive change.

In my free time, I love to work on new projects and try out new technologies. I'm currently working on a music and video streaming app 🎶🎥 using Flutter, and a medical laboratories application and CRM using NestJs, Flutter, and Angular.

I've also worked on technical graduation projects using Java, ASP.net, and Xamarin, and have closely associated with CMS projects.

So if you're looking for a developer who's always eager to learn and adapt, then look no further! 🤗
