            <strong>
                Hey there, I'm Sanu Khan, a full stack developer based in Dubai. I have been building my career in programming since the age of 16, and it has been 10 years now. I am a part-time freelance developer and programming enthusiast, who loves to work with new technologies.<br><br>
                I specialize in different PHP frameworks, CMS, JAVA, ASP.net, and front-end development with JS and jQuery. I have also explored other technologies like AngularJS, ReactJS, TypeScript, NodeJS, and expressJs. Over the years, I have associated with many clients worldwide and have worked on various projects ranging from HTML websites, real-estate ERP solutions, social networking apps, and e-commerce applications.<br><br>
                I am passionate about learning and exploring new technologies. Currently, I am working on a music and video streaming app using Flutter and a medical laboratories application and CRM using NestJs, Flutter, and Angular. Additionally, I have experience in blockchain and cyber-security research and AI innovations.<br><br>
                I am a detailed-oriented, responsible, and committed engineer with a get-it-done, on-time, and high-quality product spirit. I am a self and quick learner, self-motivated, and social.
